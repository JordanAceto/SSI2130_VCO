# SSI2130 based VCO PCB

## Features:
- Sine, Triangle, Sawtooth, and variable Pulse waves simultaneously available.
- All waveforms +/- 5vpp.
- Three 1 volt/octave inputs
- Through-zero linear FM
- Sync (choose hard or soft)
- PWM modulation inputs (choose triangle or saw input for the pulse wave)
- Designed to plug into a separate carrier pcb which houses the pots and jacks.
